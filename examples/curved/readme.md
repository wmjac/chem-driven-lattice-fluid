lattice => The instantaneous configuration of the system at the end of simulation.
list_sz => The number of B-molecules belong to the droplet measured every 100 sweeps of kMC events.
           Sometimes useful for determining whether the system has reached the steady-state.
rhoB => Average B-molecule density profile along the x and y-axes passing through the CoM of the droplet
rhoI => The same but for I-molecules.

The following data contain 3 heatmaps for which the index 0 = condensed droplet; 1 = interface; 2 = dilute phase.
entropy => Steady-state entropy production rate density
jB  => B-molecule diffusive flux along the x and y-axes passing through the CoM of the droplet
jI  => The same but for I-molecules.
NBI => B=>I chemical reactive flux density. Reaction along both passive and driven pathways are counted together.
NIB => I=>B chemcial reactive flux density. Reaction along both passive and driven pathways are counted together.
