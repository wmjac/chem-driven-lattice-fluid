lattice => The instantaneous configuration of the system at the end of simulation.
left  => Snapshots of instantaneous interface on the left-hand side collected every 100 kMC events.
right => The same but for the right-hand side interface.
rhoB => Average B-molecule density profile along the direction perpendicular to the average direction of the interface.
rhoI => The same but for I-molecules.

The following data contain 3 heatmaps for which the index 0 = condensed phase; 1 = interface; 2 = dilute phase.
entropy => Steady-state entropy production rate density
jB  => B-molecule diffusive flux along the the direction perpendicular to the average direction of the interface.
jI  => The same but for I-molecules.
NBI => B=>I chemical reactive flux density. Reaction along both passive and driven pathways are counted together.
NIB => I=>B chemcial reactive flux density. Reaction along both passive and driven pathways are counted together.
