Needs "numba" python package for faster calculation.

# Coexistence simulation across a flat interface
src/flat.py => Concentration profiles, diffusive and reactive flux densities, entropy production rate density, and interfacial roughness
'''
Example: 8 independent simulations (= batch_size) from index 0 (= start) to 7

# Coexistence simulation across a curved interface
src/curved.py => The same but flux densities are measured along the principal axes passing through the CoM of the droplet only
'''
Example: Simulation with 547 particles in the dilute phase and 225 particles in the condensed phase

# First-principles phase diagram prediction
FLEX_phase_diagram.py => Prediction on nonequilibrium phase coexistence with flat interface as in figure 3 of the main text.
'''
Example: Predictions at Λ = 10^1, 10^2, 10^3, and µdr = -2.0, 2.0 at specified parameters ε = -2.95 and \rhov = 0.05.
